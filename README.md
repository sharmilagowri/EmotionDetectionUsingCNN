Classifying the emotion on a person's face into one of the seven categories - angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised using deep convolutional neural networks. Used CNN to analyze the emotion and OpenCV to access the webcam and to detect personâ€™s face.

OpenCV: A Real-time Emotion Detection is built using deep CNN and implemented using XML haar cascade and open source computer visualization, OpenCV. The model detects the face and assigns SoftMax scores. The emotion with the highest SoftMax score is displayed as the emotion of the face
